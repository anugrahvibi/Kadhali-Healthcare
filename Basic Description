Kadhali Healthcare Helpdesk is a modern web app built with HTML5, Bootstrap 5, and vanilla JavaScript. It features a clean home page introducing the service and a FAQ + Chatbot page for instant healthcare answers. Users can securely upload medical reports in PDF format, which are processed with PDF parsing and OCR, then analyzed using AI models like OpenAI GPT-4 or local Llama 3 to extract clinical data, generate plain-language summaries, highlight urgent alerts, and create downloadable reports. The site is fully responsive for mobile and desktop, with smooth UX touches like auto-scrolling chat, timestamps, hover animations, and a minimal, modern design. Itâ€™s delivered as just two ready-to-use files (index.html, faq.html) plus a Node.js/Express backend for analysis.

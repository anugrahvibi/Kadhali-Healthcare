# 🧪 Testing Instructions

## ✅ Server Status
The backend server is now working correctly! Here's what we've fixed:

1. **Simplified upload.js** - Removed complex dependencies and made it more robust
2. **Fixed server startup** - Server now runs on port 3002
3. **Verified upload functionality** - Tested successfully with a sample PDF
4. **Updated frontend** - faq.html now points to the correct server port

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd server
node index.js
```
You should see:
```
Medical PDF Analyzer server running on port 3002
Environment: development
Health check: http://localhost:3002/health
```

### 2. Test the Upload (Backend)
```bash
cd server
node simple-test.js
```
Expected output:
```
Testing upload endpoint...
✅ Upload test successful!
```

### 3. Test the Frontend
1. Open `faq.html` in your browser
2. Look for the "📄 Upload & Analyze Report" section
3. Check the consent checkbox
4. Upload a PDF file (drag & drop or click to browse)
5. You should see the upload progress and success message

## 🔧 What's Working

- ✅ **File Upload**: PDF files are accepted and processed
- ✅ **File Validation**: Size and type checking
- ✅ **Consent Handling**: Requires user consent before processing
- ✅ **Job Management**: Each upload gets a unique job ID
- ✅ **File Storage**: Files are saved securely with unique names
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and cleanup

## 📝 Current Limitations

- **Analysis Pipeline**: The LLM analysis routes are not yet connected (this is expected for MVP)
- **PDF Report Generation**: Not yet implemented in the simplified version
- **Model Selection**: UI is there but backend analysis not connected

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to complete the full pipeline:

1. **Add Analysis Routes**: Connect the analyze.js and result.js routes
2. **Configure LLM**: Set up OpenAI API key or local Llama instance
3. **Test Full Pipeline**: Upload → Analyze → Generate Report

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Make sure you're in the `server` directory
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
- Check if port 3002 is already in use

### Upload Fails
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify server is running on port 3002
- Make sure you've checked the consent checkbox
- Try with a small PDF file (< 10MB)

### Frontend Issues
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for JavaScript errors
- Verify the API_BASE_URL is set to `http://localhost:3002/api`

## 📊 Test Results

**Last Test**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
- File: test.pdf (478 bytes)
- Job ID: 8067315c-2913-4032-8c87-24c60763e827
- Status: 200 OK
- Response: File uploaded successfully

The core upload functionality is now working perfectly! 🎉
